# MapLibre-Geoman

We are developing a MapLibre // Mapbox compatible version of the Geoman drawing plugin.

MapLibre-Geoman will be a powerful new plugin designed for creating and editing geometry layers on maps. It's fully compatible with both MapLibre and Mapbox, providing a seamless integration experience. With MapLibre-Geoman, users can draw, edit, drag, cut, rotate, split, scale, measure, snap, and pin layers with ease. It supports a wide range of geometries including markers, circle markers, polylines, polygons, circles, rectangles, image overlays, layer groups, GeoJSON, MultiLineStrings, and MultiPolygons. The plugin is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it a great tool for any project that requires interactive map features.
